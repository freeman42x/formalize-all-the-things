    Formalise:

    1.) General Intelligence
    2.) Narrow Intelligence
    3.) Ethics
    4.) Evidence
    5.) Truth
    6.) Decisions

    More proofs:

    1.) prove that a less skilled agent is less likely to understand and agree with a more skilled agent
    2.) prove that agents with high general intelligence are more likely to be nice

    TODO the context needs to be abstracted away from the laws of the reality it is in
    -- the semantics need to function in any type of reality irregardless of physics
    -- senses - inputs (consciousness O.O)
    -- example contexts:
        - being somewhere in physical reality
        - virtual context - being an agent inside of a virtual world like a game
        - simulation context - we ourselves could be in a simulation
                            - mostly irrelevant for daily lives but fun
