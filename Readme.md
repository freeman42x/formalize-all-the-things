# Formalising General Intelligence

## How is this useful?

* for creating Ethical AGI and reaching technological singularity in a safe way, see Plan
* actually useful dictionaries that provide clear meaning
* the semantic trees can be used to provide optimal pathways
  * in education for learning concepts - something that now takes many years for people to graps could be done in a way shorter time
  * in industry for optimizing achieving any goal
  * in communication - clear semantics reduce social friction, misunderstandings etc.

## Plan

* Formalise
  * General Intelligence
  * Ethics
* Use non-symbolic methods to create symbolic EAGI - Ethical AGI
